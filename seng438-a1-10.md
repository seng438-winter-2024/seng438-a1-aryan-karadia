# Introduction

An introduction of your lab work, and what you knew about exploratory and manual
functional testing before this lab

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

In this exploratory test plan, we'll follow the typical user path at an ATM. First, insert a valid ATM card, enter the associated PIN, and ensure the system progresses to the main menu. Proceed to withdraw cash in various amounts, starting from $20 and then $40. Then, we are going to make a deposit of $60 with cash and then check the balance of the chequeing account. We are also going to cancel a withdrawal midway and verify it hasn't withdrew money accidently. Deliberately enter an invalid PIN, attempt a withdrawal exceeding the balance, and simulate a transaction failure, assessing error handling mechanisms.

# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

-   Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.

# Notes and discussion of the peer reviews of defect reports

# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided 
We took turns running the program and reporting the issues. Work was divided evenly between all four members. For the pair testing, one person went through the system while the other person watched and reported and bugs that were found.


# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned
Initially, we had trouble with coming up with a high-level exploratory test plan as we are new to software testing. To overcome this, we discussed and brainstormed using the high level requirements provided to generate a test run. We learned that it is important to understand the system before jumping straight into testing the system. We also learned how to professionally report and track bugs in a group setting which mimics the real world. It also took a while to get used to Jira for reporting and tracking bugs as none of us have had experience with it in the past.


# Comments/feedback on the lab and lab document itself
The instructions were easy to follow, but it would be nice to have another guideline on how to set up the bug tracking softwares (in our case, Jira). The background information given to us about how to step through the system was very helpful.
