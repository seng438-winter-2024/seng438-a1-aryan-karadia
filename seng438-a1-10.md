# Introduction

An introduction of your lab work, and what you knew about exploratory and manual
functional testing before this lab

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

In this exploratory test plan, we'll follow the typical user path at an ATM. First, insert a valid ATM card, enter the associated PIN, and ensure the system progresses to the main menu. Proceed to withdraw cash in various amounts, starting from $20 and then $40. Then, we are going to make a depoist of $60 with cash and then check the balance of the chequeing account. We are also going to cancel a withdrawal midway and verify it hasn't withdrew money accidently. Deliberately enter an invalid PIN, attempt a withdrawal exceeding the balance, and simulate a transaction failure, assessing error handling mechanisms.
