# Introduction

An introduction of your lab work, and what you knew about exploratory and manual
functional testing before this lab

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

1. Card Authentication and PIN Entry:
Objective: Validate that the ATM correctly authenticates the user's card and allows entry of the Personal Identification Number (PIN).
2. Operator Switch and Maintenance:
Objective: Ensure the key-operated switch functions correctly for starting, stopping, and maintaining the ATM.
3. Transaction Logging:
Objective: Confirm that the internal log accurately records essential transaction details for audit and recovery purposes.
4. Error Handling and Recovery:
Objective: Ensure that the ATM provides clear explanations for transaction failures and allows the user to perform another transaction.
5. Transaction Abortion:
Objective: Ensure that the user can successfully abort a transaction in progress.
6. Balance Inquiry:
Objective: Validate that the ATM accurately retrieves and displays account balances.
7. Cash Withdrawal:
Objective: Confirm that the ATM processes cash withdrawal requests accurately.
8. Deposit Handling:
Objective: Ensure the ATM correctly processes deposits, both cash and checks.
9. Money Transfer:
Objective: Confirm that the ATM facilitates money transfers between linked accounts.
10. Receipt Generation:
Objective: Validate that the ATM generates accurate receipts for successful transactions.
